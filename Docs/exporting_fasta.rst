Exporting Sequences in FASTA format
===================================

In Geneious Prime, gather all assemblies or consensus sequences to be exported into a local folder.

Make sure the most up-to-date metadata are associated with the sequences. To do this, follow the instructions on the :ref:`Annotating_FIMS_LIMS-link` page to annotate the sequence files with the current GeOMe FIMS and Biocode LIMS data. 

If assemblies or consensus sequences need to be renamed, follow the :ref:`Batch_rename-link` instructions.

To export the documents in FASTA format, first select all relevant documents, then follow one of the two options outlined below depending on file type.

**To export from assembly files**: click on “Export” in the toolbar, then select “Export other” and “Consensus”.

In the *Consensus* window that pops up, choose settings as appropriate or leave as defaults. Click “OK”.

**To export from consensus sequence files**: click on “Export” in the toolbar, then select “Export Documents”.

After naming the fasta file and selecting the local directory in which to save it, click “Proceed” on the *Potential Data Loss* window.

In the *FASTA sequences/alignment Export* window that appears, ensure that only the middle option “Replace spaces in sequence name with underscores” is checked. Uncheck the other two options. Choose Upper case or Lower case based on user preference.
